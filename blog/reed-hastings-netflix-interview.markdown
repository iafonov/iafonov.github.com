# Netflix Reed Hastings interview

<div class="date">[17 Nov 2017]</div>

Personally I'm not a big fan of Netflix as a product (despite being a subscriber), but this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m51AWB0Zibs">interview</a> is interesting and entertaining. I recommend watching it in full.

My favorite parts:

Competition - when attacked reduce surface of attack [17:50, 5 mins]
